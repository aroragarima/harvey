Task 1 :
node title = case name/id
1. different network properties like indegree, outdegree distributions -- do they follow power law ; clustering coefficient etc.
2. average : outdegree, indegree of the cases

Tasks 2:
1. https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25791897.pdf 
see what centrality measures they are using to find out important judgments, replicate them.
report top 15-20 cases/nodes, based on the different centralities
for each of the top nodes, extract their subject

2. plot the year vs #indgree citation, #outdegree citation as mentioned in the paper

Tasks 3: 
1. Run the centrality measures (incl. degree centrality) once again on the final graph
2. Send me the rank list of the top 30 most important case *titles* (along with doc id) 

1. For the top 5 landmark judgements (that comes from the best centrality metric) plot their indegree citations over the years.
2. Extract the subjects & create a list of unique subjects, sorted in decreasing order of their frequency
3. For top 5 unique subjects, plot their frequency in each year

Tasks 4:
1. For each subject of case (mainly criminal), get unique keywords and do centrality metrics
2. Do clustering for the above subgraph and community analysis on clusters

Future work:
For paper citation networks, there was a normalized citation count over the years plot, which we can do similarly for our network
