Rules, 1983, TADA Rules, 1987</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong> (A) Criminal - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (TADA), s.5 - - General conspiracy - Possession of weapon - Conviction - Justifiability - Bombay Blast took place in which 257 persons lost their lives and 713 were injured - Bombay police investigated matter at initial stage but subsequently it was entrusted to Central Bureau of Investigation/CBI and on conclusion of investigation, chargesheet was filed against large number of accused persons - Thus, Designated Court under TADA framed charges against 138 accused persons - Appellant charged for general conspiracy and for keeping one AK-56 rifle plus two empty magazines and committed offence - Appellant (A-20) was convicted u/s. 5 of TADA and awarded sentence - Hence, instant Appeal - Whether conviction of appellant for offence was justified - Held, there was sufficient material to show that recovery was made at behest of appellant (A-20) from factory owned by partnership to which he was partner - In such fact-situation, he ought to have explained reason/source of his knowledge of such contraband articles being kept in his factory - As appellant had not mentioned that he had seen someone keeping articles there, or somebody had told him about that, or he had seen things lying there, only reasonable inference was drawn that he himself had kept same at that place - Being partner of firm if he was having knowledge that some contraband were lying in his premises, he ought to have informed police if he had no guilty mind - So far as explanation that at time of recovery appellant did not have key, would not be enough to tilt balance in his favour and no conclusion could be drawn that appellant (A-20) was not in possession of said premises, and it could not be held that appellant (A-20) was not in conscious possession of contraband material - As appellant (A-20) made statement leading to discovery of AK-56 assault rifle and two magazines having kept in his workshop and same was found concealed on loft, he could not escape from liability of possessing and concealing of same, thus liable to be punished u/s. 5 of TADA - Thus, there was no reason to interfere with conclusion drawn by Designated Court - Appeal disposed of.</p><p>(B)Criminal - Practice &amp; Procedure - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (TADA), s.5 - Arms Act, 1959 - Conviction - General conspiracy - Distribution of weapon - Justifiability - Appellant was charged for general conspiracy and for attending conspiratorial meetings where criminal conspiracy was discussed for distributing arms and ammunition to co-conspirators and for providing funds to them - After trial, appellant (A-21) stood acquitted of all charges except charges u/s. 5 of TADA and under the Arms Act - Hence, instant Appeal - Whether conviction of appellant for offence was justified - Held, Court below held that no other conclusion could emerge of appellant having committed all offences for which he was charged with on account of commission of overt acts, but same could lead any prudent man to legitimate conclusion of appellant having committed aforesaid acts for purposes of furthering object of conspiracy - Thus, Designated Court found him guilty and imposed punishment and there was no reason to interfere with directions of Designated Court - Appeal disposed of.</p><p>(C) Criminal - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (TADA), ss. 3, 5 - Arms Act, 1959 - Conviction - General conspiracy - Facilitation commission of terrorist - Justifiability - Accused was charged for general conspiracy and for facilitating commission of terrorist activities etc u/s. 3(3) TADA and for receiving and keeping in possession of one AK-56 rifle and two empty magazines with intention to use and commit terrorist acts - Thus both Accused no.20 and Accused no.21 were found guilty for offence punishable u/s. 5 of TADA and awarded punishment - Hence, instant Appeal - Whether conviction of appellant for offence was justified - Held, appellate court should not ordinarily set aside judgment of acquittal in case where two views were possible, though view of appellate court could be more probable one - While dealing with judgment of acquittal, appellate court had to consider entire evidence on record, so as to arrive at finding as to whether views of trial court were perverse or otherwise unsustainable - Similarly, wrong placing of burden of proof could also be subject-matter of scrutiny by appellate court - However, findings of fact recorded by court could be held to be perverse if findings were arrived at by ignoring or excluding relevant material or by taking into consideration irrelevant/inadmissible material - Thus finding could be said to be perverse if it was against weight of evidence, or if finding so outrageously defied logic as to suffer from vice of irrationality - Therefore, there was no legal evidence which could be relied upon by prosecution was available on record - Appeal disposed of.</p><p>(D) Criminal - Conviction - General conspiracy - Participation in landing and transportation of arms - Justifiability - Accused no.31 was convicted for charge of general conspiracy, and in addition thereto, he was further charged for participating in landing and transportation of arms, ammunition and explosives smuggled - Hence, instant Appeal - Whether conviction of appellant for offence was justified - Held, after conclusion of trial, Special Judge came to conclusion that considering confessions of co-accused, as well as statement made by PW-2 there could be no conclusion other than fact that appellant (A-31) was involved in landing and transportation operation - Thus, by observing confession of co-accused as well as deposition of various prosecution witnesses, there was no merit in appeal - Appeal disposed of.</p><p>(E)Criminal - Conviction - General conspiracy - Facilitation of commission of terrorist activities - Justifiability - Accused no.31 was convicted for charge of general conspiracy and for abetting and knowingly facilitating commission of terrorist

alongwith absconding accused to Mumbra as instructed by Tiger Memon (AA) - This version was duly supported/corroborated by appellant and by evidence PW- 2 - However, there was nothing on record to show that he was aware as of what kinds of contraband were being transported in his tempo - Therefore, there was no need to interference - Appeal dispspoed of.</p><p>(F)Criminal -Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987(TADA), ss. 3, 5 - Arms Act, 1959 - Conviction - General conspiracy - Facilitation of commission of terrorist activities - Accused no.30 was charged for

6 of TADA were committed - After conclusion of trial, appellant Accused no.30 was convicted for charges u/ss. 3(3), 6 of TADA - Hence, instant Appeal - Whether conviction of appellant for offence was justified - Held, evidence on record made it crystal clear that Accused no.30 was not only close associate of Tiger Memon (AA) and acting as landing agent, but man of confidence who could negotiate with police and customs officials to fix amount of bribe for facilitating smuggling and transportation of smuggled contraband - Appellant was person who had negotiated with police and fully aware of nature of contraband, and in spite of coming to know that contraband contained arms, ammunition and explosives, he continued to help smugglers - It was also evident that he had close association with Accused no.82, officer of customs department, who was helping smugglers by taking bribe through Accused no. 30 - Therefore, Court did not concur with findings of fact recorded by Designated Court that Accused no. 30 could not be convicted for conspiracy - Appeal dispsoed of.</p><p>(G) Criminal - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (TADA), ss. 3, 6 - Arms Act, 1959 -

ammunition, hand grenades and explosives like RDX to be used in blast and for abetting and participating in terrorist activities - Appellant Accused no.46 was convicted u/ss. 3(3), 6 of TADA - Hence, instant Appeal - Whether conviction of appellant for offence was justified - Held, Designated Court after appreciating entire evidence on record came to conclusion that appellant Accused no.46

no.46 revealed that he was in employment of Memon family, however he was to anding - Confessions of co-accused clearly established involvement of appellant Accused no.46 along with Accused no.10 for taking co-accused persons, who were sent for training, though he could not be aware of purpose for which co-accused were sent - Therefore there was not found any evidence on record to warrant interference in conclusion drawn by Designated Court - Appeal dispsoed of.</p><p>(H) Criminal - - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987(TADA), s. 3 - Aquittal - Charge of larger conspiracy - Justifiability - Appeal was filed by State against acquittal of respondent of charge of larger conspiracy - Designated Court held that hardly there being cementing material for establishing nexus of Accused no.46, Accused no.18 &amp; Accused no.28 with conspiracy for which he was charged with and material having remained confined of himself having committed of offences, it could be difficult to hold him liable for conspiracy for which he was charged with - Same was obvious as hardly there was any material indicating Accused no.46 having committed any other acts because of which he was said to be further object of conspiracy for which he was charged with - Hence, instant Appeal - Whether aquittal of appellants for offence was justified - Held, it could be difficult to accept submission to give maximum punishment to Accused nos.18, 28 - Even it was accepted that smuggling of arms, ammunition and explosives substance, even accepted to be very heinous merely on said count awarding maximum punishment to each of accused involved in such landings de hors considering extent of act committed by him and thereby assessing element of criminality exist in him would amount allowing oneself to be swayed by feeling and would amount of having acted without any logical reasoning behind it - Having regard to same while awarding punishment to Accused nos.18, 28 and Accused no. 46 it was necessary to take into account gravity of act committed by both of them - parameters laid down by court below in entertaining case against order of acquittal was justified and SC

weapons - After conclusion of trial, respondent was convicted u/s. 3(3) of TADA, but was acquitted of first charge of conspiracy - Hence, instant Appeal - Whether order of acquittal passed in favor of respondent was justified - Held, there was no evidence to show that respondent Accused no.73 ever participated in any of conspiratorial meetings after said landing, or was involved in any of operation thereafter in pursuance of conspiracy to commit serial Blast, he could be punished only for smaller conspiracy u/s. 3(3) of TADA and not for larger conspiracy for which charge no.1 was framed and for that respondent Accused no.73 was convicted and awarded sufficient punishment - However parameters laid down by Court in entertaining appeal against order of acquittal have to be applied and there was no reason to interfere in order of Court below - Appeal disposed of.</p><p>(J) Criminal - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (TADA), s. 3 - Arms Act, 1959 - Conviction -

to matters contained in confession of Accused no.62 i.e. his involvement in landing &amp; transportation operation for which he was charged with was also found in confession of co-accused no.17 - It was proved that Accused no.62 also being involved in landing operation as denoted by said material and as such having committed offence u/s.3(3) of TADA for which he was charged at head - Similarly

only for that - Thus, parameters laid down by court in entertaining appeal against order of acquittal had to be applied - Appeal disposed of.</p><p>(M) Criminal - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987(TADA), ss. 3, 6 - Conviction - General conspiracy - Statement of confession - Accused no.66 stood acquitted on first charge of conspiracy and he was convicted u/s. 3(3) of TADA and with regard to Accused no.74 Designated Court came to conclusion that on basis of disclosure statement made by appellant Accused no.74, 12 AK-56 rifles and 36 magazines and cartridges were recovered from mango groves - appellant Accused no.74 was having knowledge about the same due to being involved in shifting said contraband, would make him guilty for commission of offences u/ss. 3(3)

member of police party headed by his superior Accused no.116 and though the appellant Accused no.110 could not be said to be responsible for taking decision of permitting further transportation of said goods, however taking into account fact that he had not reported about Accused no.116 to higher officials, revealed that he had also connived with Accused no.116 in performing said acts - There was no evidence on record requiring interference with judgment of Designated Court - Appeal disposed of.</p><p>(N) Criminal - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (TADA), s. 3 -

Held, it was clear that appellant (A-99) was driving police jeep when party was headed by Accused no.116 - It was held that confessions of co-accused and of PW-97 clearly revealed involvement of appellants in landing episode - It was also held that appellants had infact been members of police party headed by their superior Accused no.116, and that though appellants could not be held to be responsible for taking decision to permit further transportation of said goods, however, taking into account fact that they had not reported Accused no.116 behaviour to higher officials, and further, recovery of large amount of money from them, clearly revealed that they had also connived with Accused no.116 to commit said acts - Thus, they were liable u/s. 3(3) of TADA - Appeals disposed of.</p><p>(O) Criminal -Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (TADA), s. 3 - Conviction - General conspiracy - Respondents were acquitted by Special Judge of Designated Court under the TADA for charge of conspiracy - Hence, instant Appeal - Whether order of acquittal to Respondents passed by Special Judge was justified - Held, in exceptional cases where there were compelling circumstances and judgment under appeal was found to be perverse, appellate court could interfere with order of acquittal - However, Appellate court should bear in mind presumption of innocence of accused and further that trial Court's acquittal bolsters presumption of his innocence - Thus, i Interference in routine manner where other view is possible should be avoided, unless there were good reasons for interference - Therefore, there was no cogent reason to interfere with order of Designated Court so far as acquittal of respondents on particular charge was concerned - Appeal disposed of.</p><p>(P)Criminal -Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987(TADA), s. 3 - Conviction - General conspiracy - Involvement in landings - In addition to main charge of conspiracy, appellant was charged for his involvement in landings including transportation of smuggled arms, ammunition and explosives and for keeping in his possession, two 9 mm pistols, 3

appellant Accused no.42 had gone to Coast - were recovered from Accused no.42 - Therefore, Designated Court held that aforesaid evidence lead to inescapable conclusion that Accused no.42 was involved in landing operations and had committed offences - However, since he had committed relevant acts much prior to date of bomb blasts and had not participated in any meetings, nor was he connected with same in any manner, and fact that acts were committed by him at time when even targets of Bomb blasts was not fixed, he could not be held guilty for offence of larger conspiracy i.e. first charge - Thus there was no reason to interfere with decision of the Designated Court - Appeal disposed of.</p><p>(Q) Criminal - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987(TADA), s. 3 - Aquittal - General conspiracy - Respondent was acquitted of charge of conspiracy - Hence, instant appeal - Whether order of acquittal was justified - Held, as respondent was awarded sufficient punishment under different heads of S. 3(3) and 6 TADA, and said offences themselves were part of conspiracy, and Designated Court had divided conspiracy into various components, where accused were either involved in participating in various conspiratorial meetings, receiving training in handling of arms, their active participation in throwing of bombs or parking of vehicles fitted with explosives, or where accused persons participated only in landing and transportation of contraband, but were not aware of contents of said contraband, and further, another category where accused had knowledge of contents of contraband, but did not participate either in conspiratorial meetings held, or in any actual incident of any terrorist activity, and had awarded different punishments - Thus, there was no cogent reason to allow said appeal - Appeal disposed of.</p><p>(R) Criminal -Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987(TADA), s. 3 - Arms Act, 1959, s.25 - Conviction - General conspiracy - Arm training - In addition to general charage of conspiracy, all three appellants were charged for their overt acts in connection with training episode - Accused no.106 and Accused no.111 were charged only for participating in training with arms and ammunition with Tiger Memon (AA) at Hillocks, while appellant No.3 Accused no.79 was charged under various heads of having possession of 13 handgrenades unauthorisedly with intent to aid terrorist activities - Fourthly, u/ss. 3 and 7 read with s. 25 (1-A)(1-B)(a) of the 1959 Act, which he had dumped in sea coast abutting village which was recovered - Hence, instant Appeal - Whether conviction of appellants was justified - Held, it was evident that PW-105 named three persons from his village participating in arms training at hillocks and one of them Accused no.79 - PW-106 named all three appellants to be members consisting of 8-10 persons participating in training of arms and ammunition and he identified all three appellants alongwith others in court - Other co-accused in their confessional statements had also named all three appellants as participants in arms training - Thus, evidence of aforesaid persons was trustworthy as there was no reason to discard same at least to extent of participation of these three appellants in arms training - Further there was sufficient evidence to convict respondents Accused nos.106, 111 u/s. 3(3) of TADA, as they also facilitated Tiger Memon (AA) in other aspects, but merely sitting at hillock, did not mean that they participated in training and therefore, it could not be basis of assuming that they were party to training programme - Appeal disposed of.</p><p>(S) Criminal -Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987(TADA), s. 3- Arms Act, 1959 - Acquittal - General conspiracy - Arm training - Respondent Accused no.79 was acquitted of charge of conspiracy -Hence, instant Appeal - Whether order of acquittal for charge of conspiracy was proper - Held, case of respondent Accused no.79 was entirely different from other co-accused, particularly those who had not participated in training of arms - It was further held that respondent Accused no.79 had knowledge of said contraband material being arms and ammunition and was brought for terrorist activities and he was found in possession of handgrenades and empties; it was further found that Accused no.79 had thrown same in creek water to absolve himself of offences - Thus, Special Judge was not justified in acquitting him from first charge of larger conspiracy merely on ground that he did not know about places where bombs had to be thrown and he was not resident and did not participate in conspiratorial meetings - Fnding of fact recorded by Special Judge was also contradictory as court held that he participated in arms training - There was sufficient material on record that respondent participated in training of handling handgrenades, there was no occasion for Special Judge to take such view - Appeal disposed of.</p><p>(T) Criminal - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987(TADA), s. 3 - Conviction - General conspiracy - Participation in terrorist acts - In addition to main charge of conspiracy, appellant was charged for participating in and assisting Memon, and his associates in landing and transportation - Designated Court held that same leaded to inescapable conclusion of appellant (A-128) being involved in landing operation as was denoted by said material and had thus committed offence u/s. 3(3) TADA - Hence instant Appeal - Whether conviction of appellant was justified - Held, confession of appellant Accused no.128 itself revealed that during course of said operation he became fully aware of nature of contraband goods i.e., same being arms and ammunition - Accused no.128 being taken for execution of said operation, and thereafter being sent for training denoted that he was man in whom Tiger Memon (AA) had confidence, as he did in other conspirators - However since appellant Accused no.128 committed relevant acts much before main conspiracy of actually committing bomb blasts planned and had not participated in any meetings or committed any acts in furtherance of said main conspiracy, it was held that he could not be held guilty for offence of larger conspiracy i.e. first charge, but was required to be held guilty for conspiracy to commit terrorist acts - Appeal disposed of.</p><p>(U) Criminal -Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987(TADA), s. 3 - Aquittal - Larger conspiracy - Though respondent Accused no.128 was convicted for various offences, he was acquitted of charge of conspiracy - Hence, instant Appeal - Whether order of acquittal of respondent Accused no.128 from charge of conspiracy was proper - Held, respondent Accused no.128 had participated in landing and transportation of arms, ammunition and explosives - It was also found that Accused no.128 had agreed to undergo weapons' training for committingterrorist acts - Accused no.128 also attended meeting at alongwith co- conspirators to plan commission of terrorist acts - Thus, respondent Accused no.128 was found guilty of conspiracy only to extent of commission of terrorist acts punishable u/s. 3(3) of TADA, and not of larger conspiracy as he could not go to Pakistan for training for handling of arms and ammunition - Thus, Accused no.128 was acquitted of charge of larger conspiracy for reason that he did not participate in any act after his return was proper - Appeal disposed of.</p></div><div
