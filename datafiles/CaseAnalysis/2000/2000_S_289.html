States Reorganization Act, 1956 - Inter-State Water Disputes Act, 1956, ss.4, 5(2), 5(3), 6 - Sharing of surplus water - Implementation of scheme - River Krishna originated in State of Maharashtra and flowed down through State of Karnataka and State of Andhra Pradesh and meets Bay of Bengal in Andhra Pradesh - When large-scale projects were taken up in one State, other riparian States were apprehensive of getting their share of water from river and for sharing water of Tungabhadra, another river in Krishna Basin, there was agreement, settling dispute concerning share of water of river Tungabhadra - Memorandum of agreement had been drawn up to remain valid for period of 25 years, State of Mysore refused to ratify agreement - After implementation of recommendations of 1956 Act, Krishna basin came to be controlled by States of Bombay, Mysore and Andhra Pradesh, which became riparian States - Whenever any of riparian State would come up with major projects, other States would object to same - Central Govt. had taken decision to clear up pending new projects on basis that withdrawal of water by States of Maharashtra, Mysore and Andhra Pradesh should not exceed 400, 600 and 800 T.M.C. - Decision of Central Govt. was not acceptable to State of Maharashtra - Krishna Waters Disputes Tribunal (KWDT) was constituted u/s.4 of the Act - In Report of TTribunal as well as in further Report, submitted by Tribunal, two Schemes was evolved - '''Cause of action indicated in plaint was refusal of defendant nos. 1,2 to consent to sharing of surplus waters in excess of 2060 TMC and for implementation of Scheme 'B'' - Hence instant Suit - Whether decision of KWDT binding on parties u/s. 6 of the Act and such scheme 'B' was capable of implementation and suit seeking implementation of Scheme 'B' was maintainable - Held, Tribunal being of opinion that it was unable to implement Scheme 'B' by its own order and having apportioned water of river Krishna as per Scheme 'A', said Scheme 'B' could not be held to be decision of Tribunal - It was true that Tribunal did entertain clarification sought for by State of Karnataka u/s.5(3) of the Act to some of clauses in Scheme 'B' and party was entitled to invoke jurisdiction of Tribunal u/s.5(3) only in respect of decision but that by itself, would not clothe Scheme 'B' with character of decision of Tribunal - However, Tribunalthere was adjudication by Tribunal in evolving scheme 'B' indicating manner in which water of said river Krishna could be shared by three States in surplus and deficit water year, but every adjudication made by Tribunal could not be held to be decision within meaning of s.5(2) of the Act unless such adjudication was capable of being implemented on its own and applied test scheme 'B' not being capable of being implemented on its own so long as back bone of scheme, namely, Constitution of Monitoring Authority was not agreed to said scheme could not be held to be decision within meaning of s.5(2) of 1956 Act - Thus, scheme 'B' framed by Tribunal was not decision of Tribunal and was not required to be notified u/s.6 of the Act and, could not be enforced at behest of plaintiff - Issues were answered against plaintiff - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(B) Water - Constitution - Inter-State Water Dispute Act,1956, ss.11, 2(c) - Constitution of India, 1950, art.262(2) - Maintainability of suit - Jurisdiction - Whether suit was maintainable in view of bar provided u/art. 262(2) of Constitution r/w s. 11 of the Act - Held, nature of assertions made in plaint and relief sought for, it was difficult to hold that it constituted dispute within meaning of s.2(c) of the Act, and therefore, jurisdiction of Court gets barred u/art.262 of the Constitution r/w s. 11 of the Act - Assertions made in plaint and relief sought for could be held to be claim on basis of an adjudicated dispute enforcement was sought for by filing suit u/art.131 of Constitution of India - Such suit could not be held to be barred u/art.262 of Constitution of India r/w s. 11 of the Act - Jurisdiction of Court gets barred in view of s.11 of the Act had to be answered by examining assertions in plaint and relief sought for and by doing so, not in position to hold that assertions in plaint together with relief sought for, constitute dispute u/s.2(c) of the Act, thereby ousting jurisdiction of Court u/s 11 of the Act - Thus, issue of maintainability was decided in favor of plaintiff and against defendants - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(C) Water - Implementation of scheme - Whether it was just, fair and equitable to implement Scheme 'B' - Held, in dispute of present nature when Court was in cession of matter before issuing any direction, Court was not examining rights of parties, flowing from any earlier order of Tribunal but also question of equitability and question of efficaciousness of any such direction - Submission of State of Andhra Pradesh to effect that tested scheme like scheme ' 'A' which had remained operative for all these years should not be given go-bye, abruptly by directly implementation of scheme ' 'B'', when it was admitted fact that not only back-bone of said scheme ' 'B'', Krishna Valley Authority, had not been constituted but also States themselves had not been able to build-up their reservoirs for storage of surplus water, which was part of scheme ' 'B'' itself - Thus, scheme 'B'' was not decision of Tribunal and as such Court would not be justified in issuing any directi'on in implementation of said scheme - Hence, issue was answered accordingly - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(D) Water - Utilization of surplus water - Execution of projects - Whether liberty to use surplus water under decision of KWDT precluded utilization of surplus water by A.P., by means of projects of permanent nature and decision of KWDT entitled State of Andhra Pradesh to execute projects - Held, issues in instant case were inter-linked - State of Andhra Pradesh, to effect that there was no fetter on manner of user of surplus water, liberty having been given, could not be accepted in such broad basis though it could not be denied that so long as scheme 'A' was under operation and so long as two upper riparian States get their share of allocation of water, lowest riparian State Andhra Pradesh could use excess water flowing down in river basin - While granting such liberty, Tribunal had not indicated as to manner of its user but same might be read into movement other part of Order was read namely such user would neither confer right nor could be deemed to have been allocated in favor of said lowest riparian State - That being nature of direction of Tribunal, it was appropriate for Central Govt. to exercise discretion while granting any scheme or project of lowest riparian state and bearing in mind, what was really meant by liberty granted, so that lowest riparian state should not be allowed to proceed ahead with large-scale water projects for utilization of surplus water in excess of allocated quantity over which, State had no right - Central Govt. which had to exercise said discretion while clearing projects of lowest riparian State and it should be so exercised that there should not be any apprehension in minds of upper States ' that for all times to come, their right of sharing surplus water would in any manner be endangered - Said issues were answered accordingly - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(E) Water - Civil Procedure - Dismissal of suit - Cause of action - Whether suit was liable to be dismissed as not disclosing cause of Action - Held, State of Karnataka being of opinion that scheme ' 'B'' evolved by Tribunal was also decision of Tribunal, which unfortunately could not be given effect to, on account of lack of consent of all States for constituting Monitoring Authority and having failed in its attempt to get said scheme implemented by getting Monitoring Authority constituted, said state filed present suit - It was refusal of State of Andhra Pradesh to agree to Constitution of an authority, thereby making scheme unimplemented, which gave cause of action to file present suit on basis of which suit had been filed and taking into account fact that State of Andhra Pradesh had never agreed to Constitution of Krishna Valley Authority, which was thought to be back-bone of scheme 'B'', it could not be said that plaintiff - State had no cause of action for filing suit - Thus, issue was answered in favor of plaintiff and against defendants - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(F) Water - Maintainability of suit - Contrary to report - Whether suit was liable to be dismissed as seeking relief which was contrary to Report and Decision of KWDT - Held, relief sought in plaint could not be held to be contrary to report as report submitted by Tribunal did contain both schemes-scheme 'A' and scheme 'B' but it was contrary to decision of Tribunal inasmuch as Tribunal itself resolved dispute referred to it by formulating scheme 'A' for distribution of water on mass allocation basis and which according to Tribunal itself was contained in final Order of Tribunal - Thus, issue was answered accordingly - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(G) Water - Civil Procedure - Premature suit - Review of order - Whether suit of Plaintiff unnecessary and premature ads there could be review of orders of Tribunal after A.D. 2000 - Held, issue had been framed at instance of State of Maharashtra, and stand taken by said State that review had been provided for, in 2000 A.D., suit filed by plaintiff was premature - While provided mass allocation in favour of three riparian States on basis of 2060 T.M.C. of water at 75% dependable flow, Tribunal itself had observed in its Original Report - Order of Tribunal could be reviewed at any time and that period was considered reasonable that during intervening period there would be increasing demands for water for irrigation and other purposes in Krishna basin which might had to be examined in light of fresh data that might be available and stupendous advance in technology in matter of conservation of water and its uses - However, review which had been indicated in Order of Tribunal was in relation to allocation made under scheme 'A' and had nothing to do with scheme 'B' - Further, plaintiff-State filed suit on assumption that scheme 'B' was decision of Tribunal and should be implemented by mandatory order of Court, such suit could not be held to be pre- mature on ground that review had been provided for after 2000 A.D - Thus. issue was answered in favor of plaintiff and against defendants - Suit dismissed.</p><p>S.B. MAJMUDAR, J.</p><p>(H) Water - Constitution - Inter-State Water Disputes Act, 1956, ss.4, 6 - Constitution of India, 1950, arts.131, 262 - Jurisdiction - Execution and implementation of award - Whether Court had jurisdiction to entertain suit - Held, disputes raised by plaintiff-State of Andhra Pradesh pertain to, alleged non-implementation of binding award of KWDT by defendant no.1 State - According to plaintiff State, earlier water dispute between plaintiff and defendant no. 1 State or for that matter defendant no. 3 State, was already adjudicated upon by Tribunal constituted u/s. 4 of the Act and which decision was published u/s.6 of the Act being decision pertaining to scheme 'A' - Grievance of plaintiff State was that though decision was binding on upper riparian States, defendant nos.1,3, executive action of concerned States amount to flouting and violation of binding decision of Tribunal - That raises question of execution and implementation of already adjudicated water dispute - Thus, it became obvious that art. 262 of Constitution would be out of picture and art.131of Constitution of India would remain operative for being invoked by disputant State against defendant States, as it would certainly raise dispute regarding execution and implementation of binding award of Tribunal and, therefore, contest did arose between two or more States - Thus, issue no. 2 would have to be answered in favour of plaintiff and against the defendants - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(I) Water - Grant of approval - Whether there was any evidence on record had shown that State of Karnataka had already approached Central Govt. for necessary approval - Held, while answering issue in question, there was no dispute between plaintiff State and defendant no. 1 State that construction of Almatti Dam with at least an FRL 519.6 m. would meet requirement of defendant no. 1 State on one hand and also grievance of plaintiff State on other hand - However, so far as another issue in question, it assumed that construction of dam within territory of Karnataka required consent of other riparian States - Approval of Central Govt. would be required under federal setup as and when any project was constructed in Karnataka State - Therefore, it could not assumed that State of Karnataka would proceed with construction of such dam without approval of Central Govt. - Thus, evidence on record had shown that it had already approached Central Govt. for necessary approval - Issues in question was answered accordingly - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(J)Water - Review of scheme - Whether raising height of Almatti Dam beyond 519 m. would fall for consideration of Tribunal when scheme 'A' would came up or review - Held, question of raising height of Almatti Dam beyond 519 m. would fall for consideration of Tribunal when scheme 'A' would come up or review already directed by KWDT in its Reports - Thus, it would considered in light of proposed scheme 'B' which might fall for consideration of appropriate water disputes Tribunal in future if complaints in this connection were raised by any of contesting States before Central Govt. - Suit dismissed.</p><p>PATTANAIK, J.</p><p>(K) Water - Inter-State Water Disputes Act,1956, ss. 11, s.5(2) - Execution of project - Violation of binding decision - Nature of project - Whether State of Karnataka violated binding decisions rendered by KWDT by executing projects and Plaintiff proved that allocation of Krishna Waters were specific for projects and not enbloc - Held, scheme B could not be held to be decision of Tribunal inasmuch as it was only that order of Tribunal which conclusively decided dispute referred to, and was capable of being implemented on its own, could be held to be decision of Tribunal u/s.5(2) of the Act - Plaintiff in instant suit based its case on scheme A contending that there was infraction of said Scheme A by defendant-State of Karnataka - However, it was clear that allocation made, had been enbloc and not project-wise and, therefore, there was no fetter on any of States in utilizing water in any project to limited extent, excepting those contained in cl. (IX) of decision - Allocation made to three States of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh for their beneficial use has been provided in cl.(V) and subject to such conditions and restrictions as were mentioned in subsequent clauses - Thus, under decision of Tribunal there had been mass allocation and no project-wise allocation contended by State of Andhra Pradesh in suit - Thus, under decision of Tribunal allocation of water in river Krishna was enbloc and not project-wise excepting those specific projects mentioned in clauses IX and X of decision - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(L)Water - Jurisdiction - Whether Court had jurisdiction to decide suit - Held, stand taken by State in additional written statement and additional issues framed thereon counsel appearing for State of Maharashtra did not argue question of jurisdiction, and on other hand contended, that jurisdiction of Court in a suit should not be restricted or narrowed down and on other hand Court should be capable of granting all necessary reliefs in adjudicating dispute raised - Plaintiff State filed suit and relief sought for it could not be said that suit was not maintainable , answer this issue in favor of plaintiff - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(M) Water - Inter-State Water Disputes Act,1956, ss.6, 5(2) - Sanction and approval - Validity of - Whether sanctions and approvals granted by Defendant no. 2 to State of Karnataka for projects, without prior concurrence of State of Andhra Pradesh were valid and binding upon Plaintiff - Held, said issues were academic in context of Upper Krishna Project of State of Karnataka and, in particular, construction of Almatti Dam - Before Tribunal, State of Karnataka had submitted report of Upper Krishna Project of which was exhibited before Tribunal as MYPK-3 and said document had been marked as Exhibit PAP-42 in instant suit - Salient features of said project, so far as Almatti Dam height was concerned, was shown as FRL 524.256 m and top of Dam at 528.786 m - Entire project itself being there before Tribunal, though Tribunal did not consider it necessary to discuss project in particular in view of enbloc allocation made by it, grievance of State of Andhra Pradesh that project was being surreptitiously constructed was devoid of any substance - Issues was answered against plaintiff - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(N)Water - Utilization of excess water - Construction of dam - Grant of saction - Whether construction of Almatti dam with FRL of 524.256 m together with all other projects executed, in progress and contemplated by Karnataka would enable it to utilise more water than allocated by Tribunal and Karnataka was permitted to proceed with construction of such dam without consent of other riparian States, and without approval of Central Govt.- Held, it was found that there should not be any bar against State of Karnataka to construct dam at Almatti upto height of 519.6 meters and question of further raising its height to 524.256 meters should be gone into by Tribunal - Solicitor General agreed on behalf of Govt. of India to be constituted immediately after delivery of judgment of these two suits, so as to mitigate grievance of each of riparian States on complaint being made by any of States - Though it might be fully desirable for all States to know about developments of other States but neither law on subject require that State even for utilization of its own water resources would take consent of other riparian States in case of an Inter-State river - Therefore, second part of issue was concerned, answer was irresistible that project of each State had to be approved by Central Govt. as well as by other statutory authorities and Planning Commission, but for which State should not proceed with construction of such project - Said issues were answered accordingly - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(O) Water - Constitution of India, 1950 u/art.131 - Submergence - Use of water in construction - Consistent with Clause - Whether user of water by State of Karnataka by constructing Dam at Almatti was in consistent with cl. XV of decision of Tribunal - Held suit filed u/art.131 of Constitution of India as part of implementation of adjudicated dispute of Tribunal - Original Project Report in relation to Almatti Dam had been produced before Tribunal, which was adjudicating disputes raised by different States, yet State of Maharashtra never thought of question of submergence and never attempted to get that question decided upon - However, wide power of Court u/art.142 of Constitution of India should be, proper to entertain question of submergence, raised by State of Maharashtra in its additional written statement and decide question of injunction, in relation to height of Almatti Dam on that basis - Thus, unable to accept submission State of Maharashtra that user of water by tState of Karnataka by constructing Dam at Almatti was in consistent with Clause XV of decision of Tribunal - Issue 9(C), therefore, answered against State of Maharashtra - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(P) Water - Oversize of reservoir and canals - Storage of water - Fixation of limit - Whether Plaintiff proved that reservoir and irrigation canals as alleged were oversized and they were contrary to Decision of Tribunal - Held, several grounds had been advanced by State of Andhra Pradesh as to why such guidance was needed, when under Scheme A allocation there had been no express provision for sharing of deficiency.- Tribunal considered same and ultimately noted in its further report under Exhibit PK-2 that State of Andhra Pradesh withdrew said note and consequently no ground for any further clarification - Note had been submitted by State of Andhra Pradesh sought clarification for fixation of limit in matter of storage of water by upper riparian States and then withdrawn same present grievance that construction of large sized Dam at Almatti by State of Karnataka would adversely affect State of Andhra Pradesh and its right could be infringed was devoid of any substance - Said issue was answered against plaintiff - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(Q) Water - Specific allocation - Whether Plaintiff State of Andhra Pradesh proved specific allocation/utilisation for UKP and canals as alleged and State of Karnataka was entitled to provide for any irrigation under Almatti canals and other new projects, when no allocation was made under decisions of KWDT - Held, suit of Plaintiff unnecessary and premature ads there could be review of orders of Tribunal after A.D. 2000 - Held, these two issues center round same question as to whether there was any specific allocation or utilization at Upper Krishna Project and whether providing for irrigation under Almatti Canal was contrary to decision of Tribunal since no allocation for irrigation had been made there under - Plaintiff State of Andhra Pradesh, had failed to establish that there was any specific allocation by Tribunal in respect of Upper Krishna Project or Almatti Reservoir and allocation was enbloc and unambiguous that States could utilize quantity of water allocated in their favor within their territory - That being position to answer these two issues against plaintiff State Andhra Pradesh and hold that plaintiff had failed to produce any materials in support of a two issues - Said issues were answered against plaintiff - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(R) Water - Reallocation of utilization - Concurrence of other states - Whether Defendant State of Karnataka was entitled unilaterally to reallocate/readjust allocation/utilisation under UKP or any other project and concurrence of other riparian States was necessary - Held, entitlement of State of Karnataka to reallocate or re-adjust utilization under UKP or any other project unilaterally did not arise at all - Tribunal made any project wise allocation and would restricted user of water under UKP to any particular quantity then question of re-allocation by State of Karnataka on its own would arisen but Tribunal not made any allocation in respect of Upper Krishna Project which includes Almatti and having made enbloc allocation so long as total user by State of Karnataka did not exceed enbloc allocation in its favor it could not be said that there had been any violation by State of Karnataka by planning to use any particular quantity of water at Almatti - Thus, neither there exists any law which compelled any State to get concurrence of other riparian States whenever it uses water in respect of inter-State river nor decision of Tribunal which allocates water in Krishna Basin on basis of 75% dependability which figure was in turn arrived at by agreement of parties puts any condition to concurrence of other riparian State - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(S) Water - Grant of permit - Violation of decision - Whether UOI could permit and/or was justified in permitting State of Karnataka to proceed with various projects which were in violation of decisions rendered by KWDT -

Suit dismissed.</p><p>(T)Water - Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 - Execution of projects - Exercise of powers - Whether Upper Krishna Stage-II Multipurpose Project could be executed without environmental clearance under the Act, and Notification issued by Central Govt. in 1994 in exercise of its power which mandatorily required various analysis including dam break analysis - Held, written memorandum furnished by State of Karnataka could not be read in isolation by spinning out particular sentence and might be read as whole -Thus, did not find any admission on part of State of Karnataka indicating any reduction of flows to State of Andhra Pradesh - However, cl. XV of Scheme B where under Tribunal itself had come to conclusion about possibility of water shortage and had empowered concerned authority to make necessary adjustment - In relation to adoption of scheme B which had not been possible on account of lack of sincerity of State of Andhra Pradesh and even Krishna Valley Authority had been empowered to determine quantity of water which was fall to share of each State and adjust uses of authorities in such matter so that by end of water year each State was enable to use water according to their share, not further examine said aspect particularly when Scheme B had not been operative so far and even Court refused to issue any mandatory injunction for adoption of scheme B in OS 1 of 1997 filed by State of Karnataka - Thus, there was no enough materials that construction of Almatti Dam by State of Karnataka had in any way affected or likely to affect State of Andhra Pradesh - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(U)Water - Cumulative utilization - Whether cumulative utilisations in K2 sub-basin was 173 TMC as claimed by State of Karnataka or 428.75 TMC as assessed by Plaintiff State - Held, plaintiff-State of Andhra Pradesh on its own estimation, made an averment in paragraph 68(b) to effect that plan utilization by State of Karnataka in K2 sub-basin is 428.75 TMC, but no positive datas was placed - State of Karnataka in its written statement asserted that under Upper Krishna Project, utilization would be to tune of 173 TMC and was apparent from several documents placed before Tribunal as well as in this proceeding - Thus, plaintiff had failed to establish that cumulative utilization in K2 sub-basin of State of Karnataka would be to tune of 428.75 TMC - Allocation was enbloc and there was no restriction for utilization in K2 sub-basin in decision of Tribunal - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(V) Water - Restrictions in utilisation of Tribunal - Whether State of Karnataka had violated KWDT award by proceeding with several new projects in sub-basin such as K-6, K-8 and K- 9 in respect of which restrictions in quantum of utilisation was imposed in final decision of Tribunal - Held, issue related to decision Tribunal in cl.(IX), under which cl. restrictions had been put - State of Andhra Pradesh had not establish allegation made in this regard nor even State had made any submission thereon - During course of hearing of suit, State of Andhra Pradesh, written submissions had been filed and even after close of hearing, State of Andhra Pradesh had filed written submission, in which, there had been no mention about alleged violation in sub-basin K-6, K-8 and K-9 - Thus, plaintiff had failed to establish same and issue was answered against plaintiff - Suit dismissed.</p><p>(W) Water - Utilisation of water - Whether utilisation under Almatti would be of order of 91 TMC as claimed in plaint - Held, issue relateD to utilization of water under Almatti - In paragraph 66(iii), plaintiff made averment, which had been denied and explained in WS by State of Karnataka vide paragraph 12.85 and State of Karnataka further averred that entire utilization at Almatti was within its allocable share and no injury was caused to State of Andhra Pradesh - However, decision of Tribunal, allocation was enbloc and not project-wise, even if it was held that utilization under Almatti would be of order of 91 TMC, as claimed, same would not violate decision of Tribunal - Thus, no positive material was found that utilization under Almatti would be of order of 91 TMC - Suit dismissed.</p></div><div class="locatorSection"><h3 id="casescited">All Cases Cited</h3><p><strong>Referred</strong></p><p>Colgate Palmolive (India) Limited v Hindustan Lever Limited<br /><a href="/maf/wlin/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;&amp;context=20354&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=I31A16EB2006E11DFBEF1C9F02835E615">1999 Indlaw SC 206, (1999) 7 SCC 1, AIR 1999 SC 3105, AIR 1999 SCW 3050, 1999 (4) CompLJ 1, 1999 (2) CPJ 17, JT 1999 (6) SC 89, [1999] Supp1 S.C.R. 560</a></p><p>Belgaum Gardeners Cooperative Production Supply and Sales Society Limited v State of Karnataka<br /><a href="/maf/wlin/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;&amp;context=20354&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=I0C1E5040006E11DFBEF1C9F02835E615">1992 Indlaw SC 993, (1993) Supp1 SCC 96A, AIR 1992 SCW 119</a></p><p>Delhi Judicial Service Association, Tis Hazari Court, Delhi v State Of Gujarat And Ors.
